# String Calculator Exercise

The idea of this exercise is to accompany some slides on an introduction to using mocks and stubs in unit tests, and TDD.

The three exercises are as follows:

- [Exercise One](exercise-one.md)
- [Exercise Two](exercise-two.md)
- [Exercise Three](exercise-three.md)

There are starters of a few languages already but pull requests with new ones are definitely welcome!
