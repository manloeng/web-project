# Exercise Two: Let's test the new functionality

For this, we want to test our new output writer that our fake colleague has added, so that we can then make changes and fall back on the tests.

We also want to be comfortable with this new functionality. This could be thought of as the concept of a "Characterization Test", but that's not the main focus of this exercise. If you're interested in that subject though, there's plenty of further reading available, that should probably start with this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test

The main focus of this scenario is to create a mock that allows you to test that the functionality you expect is happening is actually happening.

For this I'd recommend a new test, since then you're keeping your unit tests testing individual things.

If you're stuck at any point or want a few hints or pointers, just ask one of us and we'll be more than happy to help.
