# JS Readme

This example uses mocha and chai. To run it, do the following:

- `npm install mocha -g` (this will install mocha globally on your machine, so may require root/admin access)
- `npm i` (this will install the dependencies for this project, and should be run from the same directory as this readme)
- `mocha test --watch` (this will run the tests, and watch them, telling us when they fail)
